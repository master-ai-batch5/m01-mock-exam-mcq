    a is not a subspace, because it does not contain the zero vector
    b is not a subspace, because it does not contain the zero vector
    c is a set of k vectors, not a linear combination of these vectors. It is therefore not a subspace.
    d is a subspace

    dg: rank is exactly 3... I don't know what you mean with "at most"
    e: hyperplane of dim 3 - or do you mean hyperplanes always have dim 2? It wasn't introduced in the course

    a) A is invertible, but it may not be diagonalizable ==> FALSE
    b) A is invertible ==> det must be != 0 ==> det is product of eigenvalues ==> none of them can be 0, or their product would be 0. ==> TRUE
    c) B is invertible, but it may not be diagonalizable ==> FALSE
    d) eigenvalues and symmetry have nothing to do with each other ==> FALSE (that's not a proof, that's a way to answer the question quickly in an MCQ - you could search for a counter example as a proof)
    e) yes it can be, it'll just have 0 on the diagonal. Example: (0), ie: the number 0, as a 1x1 matrix has 1 eigenvalue == 0, and is already in diagonal form... ==> FALSE
    f) no. one of them could be 0, and cf answer b) above... ==> FALSE

    a is a trap: double check the product expression: the lambdas are 0, 1, and 1 (not -1!) so the trace is 2, not 0.

    the question does not SAY "strictly" positive eigenvalues, but they MEAN it
    if one eigenvalue were 0, then matrix would not be invertible, which impacts c) and d)

    e TRUE (this is the correct relation between lambdas and sigmas) ==> a & d must be FALSE   
    b TRUE (see below) ==> c must be FALSE
        A is symmetric => eigenvectors are orthogonal => diagonalizable via an orthonormal matrix: A = U Lambda U^T (U inverse = U transposed)
        - proof#1:
            u3 can be computed as cross-product
            => we can compute U
            => we can compute A
            => b is TRUE (NB: would also work if lambda3 were not 0)
        - proof#2:
            when computing U Lambda U^T, components of u_3 are multiplied by lambda3=0, so they don't matter
            => we can compute A without needing u_3
            => b is TRUE (would also work if there were more missing eigenvectors with eigenvalues = 0)
