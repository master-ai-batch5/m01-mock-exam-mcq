    dg: rank is exactly 3... I don't know what you mean with "at most"
    e: hyperplane of dim 3 - or do you mean hyperplanes always have dim 2? It wasn't introduced in the course

    responses c and d are unclear:
    - question does not say _strictly_ positive eigenvalues
    - if one eigenvalue is 0, then matrix is not invertible
    - if they meant strictly positive, I don't know the answer
